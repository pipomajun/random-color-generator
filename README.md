Random Color Generator

## Create an application that will return a random color in the command line.

It should work like this:

When a user enters `node index.js` in the command line, a block of approximately 31x9 `#` characters colored with a random color (using hex code, e.g. `#ff0000`) should be generated.

## In addition to `node index.js`, it should also be able to accept the request for a:

- hue (e.g. green or red or blue)
- luminosity (e.g. light or dark)

...and then generate random colors that match those choices.
